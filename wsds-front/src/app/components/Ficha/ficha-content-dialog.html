  <h3>Architecture overview</h3>

  <p>Angular is a platform and framework for building client applications in HTML and TypeScript.
  Angular is itself written in TypeScript. It implements core and optional functionality as a
  set of TypeScript libraries that you import into your apps.</p>

  <p>Components define views, which are sets of screen elements that Angular can choose among and
  modify according to your program logic and data. Every app has at least a root component.</p>
